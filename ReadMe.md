# 🛍️ E-Commerce CLI App

A beginner-friendly command-line shopping system built with Python and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). Users can browse products, add items to a cart, remove them, and checkout — all from the terminal.

---

## 🚀 Summary

This project demonstrates core OOP principles:
- **Encapsulation**: Product data is protected and accessed via methods.
- **Inheritance**: Specialized product types extend a base `Product` class.
- **Polymorphism**: Each product type applies its own discount logic.
- **Abstraction & Composition**: The `Cart` class manages shopping logic and holds multiple products.

It’s designed for clarity, modularity, and ease of learning — perfect for beginners exploring OOP in Python.
